# To-Do List Application

This is a simple To-Do List application built using HTML, CSS (Bootstrap), and JavaScript. The application allows users to add, display, and delete tasks, with data being stored in the browser's local storage.

## Features

- **Add Tasks:** Users can input a title and description for each task and add it to the list.
- **Delete Tasks:** Tasks can be easily removed from the list with a delete button.
- **Local Storage:** Tasks are saved using the browser's local storage, so even after refreshing the page, the tasks remain available.
- **Clear All Tasks:** A clear button is available to remove all tasks at once.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Structure of the application.
- **CSS3 (Bootstrap 5)**: Styling and layout of the application.
- **JavaScript**: Handles the logic for adding, deleting, and updating tasks.

## How It Works

1. The user can add a task by filling out the title and description fields and clicking the "Add to List" button.
2. The tasks are stored in the browserâ€™s local storage.
3. The list is updated dynamically and displays all stored tasks.
4. The user can delete individual tasks or clear the entire list.
